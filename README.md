# Ethereum/Solidity smart contracts for Esprezzo.io crowdsale

This is currently under heavy development and deployed on the Ropstem Testnet.

Our crowdsale contracts are based on the heavily reviewed OpenZeppelin framework. These are currently highly experimental and will change significantly before going live on Ethereum Mainnet (currently Metropolis).
